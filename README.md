## Game Information 🍀

**Wordle gives players six chances to guess a randomly selected five-letter word. A letter that isn't in the word in any spot shows up gray, a letter that is in the word but in the wrong spot shows up yellowish-orange, a letter that is in the word and is in the correct spot shows up green. You can enter a total of six words, meaning you can enter five burner words from which you can learn hints about the letters and their placements.**
